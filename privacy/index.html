Cookies are used to store and receive identifiers and other information on computers, phones, and other devices. Other technologies, including data we store on your web browser or device, identifiers associated with your device, and other software, are used for similar purposes. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to all of these technologies as "Cookies."</p>
            <p>We use Cookies on our Website to (a) understand and save your preferences for future visits, (b) keep track of advertisements, (c) compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future; and (d) allow trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.  You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser Cookies, but it may affect your user experience. We honor Do Not Track signals and, if one is in place, we will not track, plant cookies, or use advertising. </p>
            <p>We allow third party behavioral tracking and links to third-party web pages.  Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our Website or App.  These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.
